# ubuntu-cloud-aggreg8streams
[Datasette](https://datasette.io/) based project for populating and viewing Ubuntu cloud simplestreams data

See https://aggreg8streams.tinyviking.ie/ for example hosted [datasette](https://datasette.io/) instance

I built this database so that Ubuntu public cloud image data could be queryied with very specific filters and 
results returned quickly without having to download all data - as is the case with 
[Ubuntu streams data](http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/releases/streams/v1/). It also removes the need for any library 
like boto to query cloud image data. A simple HTTP request will return what you need.

One of the huge benefits of using [datasette](https://datasette.io/) to achieve this is being able to serve results 
to queries in json or csv.

Example:

* [Find the latest Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic Minimal on AWS in the eu-west-1 region and return as json](https://aggreg8streams.tinyviking.ie/simplestreams.json?sql=select+image_id+from+cloudimage+where+label+%3D+%27release%27+and+release+%3D+%27bionic%27+and+family+%3D+%27minimal%27+and+content_id+%3D+%27com.ubuntu.cloud%3Areleased%3Aaws%27+and+crsn+%3D+%27eu-west-1%27+order+by+version_name+desc+limit+1&_shape=arrayfirst)
  * This will return a single AWS Machine image ID in a JSON list. The payload is 383 bytes and takes 39ms being served from a very old intel nuc in my network closet. It takes no setup of libraries, and you only downloaded the data you needed.  

Any query can be bookmarked and used in your automation.

See [datasette documentation on the JSON API](https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/json_api.html) for more details on 
how to change the format of your query results.

## Example command to run datasette with sample database

Save the current database from demo/example site locally

```
wget https://aggreg8streams.tinyviking.ie/simplestreams.db --show-progress --output-document=simplestreams.db
```

Run datasette server with this database

```
python3 -m datasette serve --immutable ./simplestreams.db --port 8001 --cors --metadata ./simplestreams-datasette-metadata.json -h 0.0.0.0
```
